I was avergang the sub matrices and then caluclating the correlation coefficient from the list of averages.

The Correlations from coarse graining much more accurately reflects our higher resolution model now that
the correlation coefficient is being taken on each sub matrix and not on the list of already computed averages.

Logically, this approach should've been used in the beginning since the correlation coefficient equation takes
averages of each sub matrix and finds the difference between each value in the sub matrix.
